This is a step by step instructions on how to set up GPFS (General Parallel File System) in virtual servers at Softlayer. 

# Softlayer
Softlayer is a cloud service provider that is now under IBM acquisition. You can setup virtual servers at the Softlayer Cloud, privision as many as you want, customize the server specification, create a cluster, submit your job, tear down the server, etc etc. 

# GPFS
GPFS is a filesystem that require license fee. In contrast, HDFS was developed to counter GPFS and it is an opensource. There are pros and cons in both file system. Here we will explore how to set up GPFS in your virutal servers. 

# Mumbler
This is a program that will detect the bigrams (two words such as `financial analysis`, `football field`, etc), and will generate how many of user specified bigrams in the repository. We will download the bigram repository made by Google at 2009. This repo consists of all bigrams before 2009. We will create an application that will search all key words user input from the repository. 

We first download the repo into our virtual servers or nodes. We will then create an application that will search the key words in parallel across all the nodes we will provision in the softlayer cloud.
